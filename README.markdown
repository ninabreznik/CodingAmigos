Coding Amigos is a community of Entrepreneurial Nomadic Developers with Activistic Streak. We are based in Berlin, but we cruise all around the world.

We organize [meetups](www.meetup.com/codingamigos) and [build stuff](www.codingamigos.com).

You find us on our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/codingamigos/chat) or every Tuesday and Friday in [CoUp, Berlin](http://co-up.de/events.html) for night hacking.
